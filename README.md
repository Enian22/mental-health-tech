# 🧠 Mental Health in Tech Industry – Data Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores factors affecting mental health among tech professionals using the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset. It includes data cleaning, EDA, machine learning modeling, and an interactive Tableau dashboard to identify trends and predict help-seeking behavior.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze how demographics and work environments influence mental health.
- Predict whether an employee is likely to seek treatment.
- Build a visual story for non-technical stakeholders.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights
- Employees with a family history of mental illness are **3x more likely** to seek treatment.
- Remote workers tend to have **higher mental health awareness**.
- Smaller companies often lack formal mental health support.

## 🤖 Model Performance
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **ROC-AUC Score:** 0.82
- **Top Predictors:** Family history, work interference, remote work status

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- Age vs Treatment Analysis
- Company Size vs Mental Health Support
- Filterable by Country, Gender, Remote Work

## 📦 ML Techniques
- Logistic Regression for treatment prediction
- Clustering (KMeans) to segment high-risk employees
